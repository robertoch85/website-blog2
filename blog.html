            <p>A Martian have been seen in the town in the afternoon of the 1st of March.
            Everybody was behaving as nothing happened, because everybody was thinking that it was
            just a costume. People started to suspect that he was a martian because the costume looked
            very real to be a fake and because he was talking in a weird and different language that
            nobody could understand.</p>
            <p>People then, decided to call the police and in about an hour a police car appeared
            there. Policemen first thought that it was a joke made by kids because the could not
            believe there was a martian in the town. That was the reason why they lasted so much
            time in arrive there.</p>

            <p>Policemen tried to speak to the martian as well but they could not understand
            what he was trying to say. After couple hours struggling then they decide to call a
            scientist specialized in paranormal phenomena.</p>
            <blockquote>We tried everything to speak and understand the martian but apparently he was
            speaking a very different language that we never heard before. We decided to wait for
            experts on the paranormal phenomena, and try to calm down to all the people. - Police
            Officer</blockquote>
            <p>The scientist, Doctor Norman Krugger, arrived there in two hours by helicopter with
            some of his equipment. After about half an hour working with a martian language's
            translator, Doctor Krugger said that the martian was "Asking for the toilet, cause it
            was a very long journey."</p>
